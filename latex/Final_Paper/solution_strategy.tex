\section{Solution Strategy}
    \subsection{Bellman Equation Application}
    The Bellman equation applies here by incorporating each weekâ€™s expected reward adjusted by discounted past outcomes. Rewards from previous weeks decrease linearly in influence.

    \subsection{Model Training and Evaluation}
    We will employ reinforcement learning techniques to train the model, using accuracy and profitability as evaluation metrics.
